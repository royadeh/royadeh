## 📂 My Public Projects

Here are some of the public projects I’ve developed and contributed to:

###Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
### **SmartRisk: ALM Risk Monitoring Dashboard**  
An early warning system for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) risk built with machine learning and Streamlit.  
- Simulates realistic financial data  
- Predicts risk scores with XGBoost  
- Detects anomalies with Isolation Forest  
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yourusername/smartrisk)


###🔍 Unsupervised Deep Learning for Human Re-Identification

A convolutional neural network for person re-identification across multiple camera views.

   - Leverages transfer learning and knowledge distillation techniques
   - Designed for unsupervised learning without labeled data
   - Robust to cross-camera appearance variations

### A scalable recommender system built with PyTorch, Docker, and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

  - Supports intelligent matching and ranking
  - Containerized and optimized for cloud deployment
  -  Easy to integrate as a RESTful API

### 📊 Anomaly Detection in 2D Data

This project demonstrates **unsupervised anomaly detection** using parametric, distance-based, and density-based models.  
It applies Mahalanobis distance, k-NN outlier detection, and local density estimation on synthetic 2D datasets (`compound`, `flame`, `pathbased`, and `G-data`).
- No labels required — fully **unsupervised**
- Multiple models: Mahalanobis, k-NN, density ratio
- Visual anomaly heatmaps with Matplotlib
- Top anomalies ranked for each method
- 🧠 [View the Anomaly Detection Notebook](https://github.com/royadeh/Data-Science/blob/main/AnamolyDetection.ipynb)


### Decision Tree-Based Credit Risk Prediction

Developed a decision tree classifier on a financial credit dataset to predict credit risk. Implemented performance evaluation via cross-validation and holdout testing, and analyzed model overfitting via depth tuning.
