## My Public Projects


### Unsupervised Deep Learning for Human Re-Identification

A convolutional neural network for person re-identification across multiple camera views.  
- Leverages transfer learning and knowledge distillation techniques  
- Designed for unsupervised learning without labeled data  
- Robust to cross-camera appearance variations

### Scalable Recommender System

Built with PyTorch, Docker, and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  
- Supports intelligent matching and ranking  
- Containerized and optimized for cloud deployment  
- Easy to integrate as a RESTful API

### Anomaly Detection 

- No labels required — fully unsupervised  
- Multiple models: Mahalanobis, k-NN, density ratio  
- Visual anomaly heatmaps with Matplotlib  
- Top anomalies ranked for each method
