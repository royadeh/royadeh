### Discord-Based Movie Recommendation System Enhanced with ChatGPT

A Discord-based movie recommender system using collaborative filtering and ChatGPT to deliver personalized suggestions with natural-language summaries.

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Uses collaborative filtering to suggest movies tailored to the user’s taste.
- **Machine Learning-Based**: Built with the [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) library and trained on the MovieLens dataset.
- **Natural Language Summaries**: Integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate human-like descriptions for each recommended movie.
- **Discord Bot Integration**: Fully functional Discord bot that responds to user commands and provides real-time recommendations.
