## üìÇ My Public Projects

Here are some of the public projects I‚Äôve developed and contributed to:

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

### **SmartRisk: ALM Risk Monitoring Dashboard**  
An early warning system for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) risk built with machine learning and Streamlit.  
- Simulates realistic financial data  
- Predicts risk scores with XGBoost  
- Detects anomalies with Isolation Forest  
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring

### üîç Unsupervised Deep Learning for Human Re-Identification

A convolutional neural network for person re-identification across multiple camera views.  
- Leverages transfer learning and knowledge distillation techniques  
- Designed for unsupervised learning without labeled data  
- Robust to cross-camera appearance variations  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/royadeh/Unsupervised-Deep-Learning-Human-Re_Identification)

### Scalable Recommender System

Built with PyTorch, Docker, and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  
- Supports intelligent matching and ranking  
- Containerized and optimized for cloud deployment  
- Easy to integrate as a RESTful API  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/royadeh/API-GCP-RecomSystem)

### üìä Anomaly Detection in 2D Data

Demonstrates **unsupervised anomaly detection** using parametric, distance-based, and density-based models on synthetic 2D datasets (`compound`, `flame`, `pathbased`, and `G-data`).  
- No labels required ‚Äî fully unsupervised  
- Multiple models: Mahalanobis, k-NN, density ratio  
- Visual anomaly heatmaps with Matplotlib  
- Top anomalies ranked for each method

### Decision Tree-Based Credit Risk Prediction

Developed a decision tree classifier on a financial credit dataset to predict credit risk. Implemented performance evaluation via cross-validation and holdout testing, and analyzed model overfitting via depth tuning.
